## Machines

Check your exam portal for specific objectives and point values of each machine.

### Standalone (60 points)
- 3 machines
	- 10 points for local
	- 10 points for proof

**Note that the targets containing these files are detailed in your exam control panel.**

### AD (40 points)
- 3 machines
	- local.txts and proof.txt on DC
	- Need to submit proof.txt to get any points
	- Only need to report if you get the proof.txt
	- Don't forget to go back and look for any local.txts and proof.txts

## Code
- If you use a script:
	- post a URL to the script if you didn't modify it
	- post the code if you did with an explanation and highlight the parts you changed.

## Proof
- Must have interactive shell as `root` `SYSTEM` `administrator` or user with admin privileges.
- `cat` or `type` the flag
- use `ipconfig` or `ifconfig` to print the IP address of the machine
- **Screenshots must have IP of the machine and contents of proof.txt in the screenshot**

## Metasploit
- Can only use metasploit/meterpreter payload on **ONE** target machine. Once you choose the target you can use it any number of times on that target, but if it doesn't work you can't choose another target.
- You can use **multi/handler** on any number of targets and **msfvenom** as well.

## Point Loss
You will receive no points for a specific target for the following:
- Using a restricted tool
- Using Metasploit Auxiliary, Exploit, or Post modules on multiple machines
- Using the Meterpreter payload on multiple machines
- Failure to provide the local.txt and proof.txt file contents in both the control panel and in an interactive shell screenshot
- Lack of documentation
